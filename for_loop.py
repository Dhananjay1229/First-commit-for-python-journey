# for loop is equivalent to while loop
# in while loop we put on a condition i.e i <= 10 
# in for loop we put on a range i.e  i in range (10)

# i = 1
# while i <= 10:
#     print(f"Hello: {i}")
#     i += 1

# for i in range(1,11): # range(expected output +1)
#     print(f"Hello D: {i} \"How'z the Day?\" " )

# name = "Dhananjay"
# for i in name:
#     print(i)

# number = [143]
# for i in number:
#     print(i)
